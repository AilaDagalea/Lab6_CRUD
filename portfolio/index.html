                <h2> AILA CHRISHEL</h2>
                <p>When she looks at me
                    I know the girl sees things
                    Nobody else can see
                    All of the secret fears inside
                    And all the craziness I hide
                    She looks into my soul
                    And reads me like nobody can
                    And she doesn't judge the man
                    She just takes me as I am
                    Come what may, she believes
                    And that faith is something
                    I've never known before
                    Come what may, she loves me
                    And that love has helped me open a door
                    Making me love myself a little more
                    When I turn away
                    She knows those are the times
                    There's nothing she can say
                    Nothing that anyone can do
                    And so she lets me live it through
                    And when I'm in my darkest hour of uncertainty
                    She just simply lets me be
                    And goes right on loving me
                    Come what may, she believes
                    And that faith is something
                    I've never known before
                    Come what may, she loves me
                    And that love has helped me open a door
                    Making me love myself a little more
                    And when it seems my dreams
                    Have all slipped through my fingers
                    When they just can't be found
                    I turn around and there they are
                    Shining in her eyes
                    Come what may, she believes
                    And that faith is something
                    I've never known before
                    Come what may, she loves me
                    And that love has helped me open a door
                    Making me love myself a little more
